## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of calm focus and determination, aligning with the perseverance needed for habit formation.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F8FF) provides a serene and uncluttered backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted Violet (#8A2BE2), creating visual interest without being overwhelming. Used for interactive elements such as the current date, tick marks, and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', serif, for a readable and elegant appearance.
- Minimalistic icons with subtle animations to represent settings, reset options, and reminders. These should be designed to complement the font choices, ensuring a cohesive aesthetic experience.
- Clean and intuitive layout with a prominent calendar view. Place progress indicators directly below for easy tracking, maximizing user engagement and minimizing clutter. A clean layout with sufficient whitespace should be employed.
- Use subtle, non-intrusive animations when toggling dates on the calendar and when milestones are reached to provide positive feedback. The design should be as visually appealing and satisfying as possible.
